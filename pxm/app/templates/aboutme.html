<h3><b>About Me</b></h3>
<p>I have a bachelor's degree in finance from Northern Illinois University. After ungraduate study, I attended DePaul University to pursue a master's degree in computational finance and it was during this time I realized my passion for programming. I began my tech career as a support engineer, then moved on to a software project manager, followed by a solutions consultant for some of the top fortune 100 and 500 e-commerce companies in the United States. I am self-taught python programmer with over 5 years of experience building a vast array of web applications and software applications. My girlfriend and I are currently renovating a duplex loft that was once a jazz recording studio in the Chicago West Loop. When I am not demoing, I am writing comedy spec scripts for my favorite shows, Seinfeld and The Office.
